# Daniels Distinction Portfolio
<i>Toby Noyes – March 2024 – Business Analytics</i>
<br><br>
Welcome to my Daniels Distinction Portfolio, highlighting my undergraduate experiences and work at the University of Denver!
<br>
<br>
I am a recent undergraduate student at the University of Denver, where I studied Marketing and Business Data Analytics. My time at DU was full of endless new experiences, nights of endless studying, and an appreciation for data and the possibility of a sustainable world. 
<br> 
<br>
Highlights of my studies include the fostering of technical and soft skills. My main skills focus on coding, marketing, analytics, campaign management, and microsoft platforms. Other skills include an enhanced learning spirit that has allowed me to gain certifications in Ai Automation and publish research articles through LinkedIn. I encourage you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-wyn-noyes/) and read some of my articles

### Coding Classes at the University of Denver
<i>Winter 2022 - Winter 2023</i>
<br>
<br>In the Winter of 2022 I was finally able to take the Advanced Excel Class, a course I had been interested in for over a year but never worked with my schedule. Before this, I had experience in spreadsheets but no exposure to code. Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to develop some ground coding skills and discover that this was a field that I excelled in. Within four weeks of the class, I changed my studies to minor in Business Data Analytics and learn as many new skills as I could in my last year of undergraduate. The next quarter, I became certified in python through google and developed a love for the innovation and challenge of coding. During my undergraduate enrollment at DU I have taken relevant courses in Python coding, HTML basics, coding ethics, and experienced some SQL coding during my Advanced Excel course.
<br>

### Applying Coding Knowledge Beyond the Classroom
Following my junior year, I took an internship for a green-tech software startup. During the first weeks here, I was asked to design a code that could automatically sort their data from two different sites using a technique called "fuzzy matching". Fuzzy matching was a completely new term for me, entailing connecting two sources who's input match a certain perent. Understanding the opportunity I had to cultivate imapctful work for this company, I agreed to give it a go and taught myself how to write complex code after only 10 weeks of prior coding experience. The Fuzzy Matching project ended up taking 6 days, matching over 800 records for the company to use and providing a code that could be copied and applied to other resources when needed. 
<br>
<br>To begin the project, I ensured that the files uploaded properly, the code was working, and that someone within the company that was unfamiliar with coding would be able to understand what was happening through descriptive comments.

<br>Next I tested the fuzzy matching code with some sample variables to ensure that they would only match if they were 80% similiar or more

<br>The biggest challenge for this code was converting the data to be read and motified by the python code, before being returned to an excel file. In addition, I had to add information to empty rows and ensure everything went in the right spot. I was able to teach myself how to do this through working with AI platforms and using my knowledge on coding procedures.

<br>Taking on intimidating work like this came with much more reward then struggle. This project helped me understand the balance and patience it takes to try something new, as well as the satisfaction of creating true value to a company.

### Marketing Skills at The University of Denver
I came into the University of Denver with a major in marketing and minor in psychology. Through the first three years of my studies, my minor changed 4 times from psychology, management, environmental science, and eventually business data analytics. One thing never changed for me though and that was my passion for marketing. My love for this profession goes beyond the classrooms, with new certifications and learning in my spare time, as well as a summer internship in both sales operations and marketing.
<br>
<br>During my education, I have designed multiple websites and created various professional presentations for real companies. The Daniels experience puts real-work environments at the forefront of their ciriculum. Some notable projects include the Madden Challenge, a group project that requires students to come up with an innovative company and make a plan for it's implementation. This course, that takes place in the first year of Daniels undergraduate, requires students to use creative thinking, colloboration, and begin to understand how to request funding for projects. A quick exposure like this to real-life work simulations was the biggest sign to me that Daniels wants its student to be ready for work upon graduation. Since this time, I've presented for 5 companies, developed 4 professional websites, and gained the skills I need to incorporate my skills post-graduation at a company.

### Marketing Skills at my Summer Internship
Using the skills developed at Daniels, I had a role as a marketing intern at Gridium in the Summer of 2023. This company was a startup, who had only just created the roll of marketing, meaning there was an abundance of work to complete. In my role here I was in charge of communicating sales data between the marketing and sales departments. In addition to the coding work shown above, I worked in spreadsheets to organize marketing campaign networking, completed various data organization tasks and helped organize teams before big events. The biggest highlight for my marketing role was writting a blog about one of the webinars that Gridium attended. In the time at this company, I learned about the importance of understanding everything your business does and the various industry trends going on. I put my marketing skills to the test with my blog that I was able to publish on the company website and on LinkedIn.

## Certifications and Extra Skills
During my time at Daniels College of Business, I was fortunate to receive a comprehensive education that not only focused on theoretical knowledge but also emphasized practical skills through certifications. The curriculum provided an in-depth understanding of various Microsoft platforms, including Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, culminating in certifications that solidified my proficiency in these essential tools. Building upon this foundation, I pursued an Advanced Excel certification, further enhancing my abilities in data analysis and visualization.
<br>
<br>
Daniels College equipped me with certifications in cutting-edge digital marketing technologies. I attained certifications in Google Analytics, Google Ads, and HubSpot Marketing Software, empowering me to effectively leverage data-driven strategies in digital marketing campaigns. Additionally, I completed a Digital Marketing Simternship, gaining hands-on experience in executing marketing initiatives in a simulated business environment.
<br>
<br>
Driven by a fervent curiosity and a dedication to continuous learning, I pursued further certifications independently. Over the past four years, I have invested my free time in acquiring proficiency in diverse domains. I have obtained certifications in Python, Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML, showcasing my versatility in both programming and design realms. Furthermore, my exploration into emerging technologies led me to attain certifications in Inbound Marketing, AI Fundamentals, and AI Applications, demonstrating my adaptability to evolving industry trends. Currently, I am actively working towards achieving certifications in Java and SQL, further expanding my skill set to meet the demands of an ever-evolving technological landscape.
<br>
## Networking
In my pursuit of professional growth, I recognized the pivotal role that networking plays in advancing one's career. To complement my existing certifications, I sought to enhance my networking skills, understanding that forging meaningful connections within the industry could open doors to new opportunities and insights.
<br>
<br>
I embarked on a deliberate journey to refine my networking abilities, beginning with the development of a comprehensive LinkedIn profile. This platform serves as a cornerstone for my networking efforts, providing a space to showcase my professional achievements, skills, and aspirations. Moreover, I actively engage with industry peers, thought leaders, and potential collaborators, fostering connections that transcend digital interactions.
<br>
<br>
To augment my networking proficiency, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. I diligently seek out new tools, techniques, and resources aimed at optimizing my networking endeavors. Additionally, I avidly consume industry-related literature and attend networking events to stay abreast of emerging trends and best practices. I leverage my expertise and insights by contributing articles and posts on LinkedIn's publishing platform. This not only reinforces my credibility as a thought leader but also serves as a catalyst for meaningful conversations and connections within my professional network.
<br>
## Volunteer Work
Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, volunteering holds a special place in my heart, reflecting a commitment that has endured since my middle school years and continues to be a cornerstone of my identity as an adult.
<br>
<br>
One of the significant volunteering experiences I cherish is my involvement with Soccerwithoutboarders, a soccer program tailored for refugees in California. Here, I dedicated my free time to coaching children in soccer, offering academic support during summer school sessions, and ensuring they had access to essential soccer equipment. Witnessing the joy and empowerment that sports brought to these young individuals was immensely gratifying.
<br>
<br>
Volunteering goes hand in hand with my sustainability goals, as it's important for me to contribute positively to the communities around me whenever I can.
